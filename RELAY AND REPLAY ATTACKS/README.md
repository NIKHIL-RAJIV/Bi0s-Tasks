# RELAY AND REPLAY ATTACKS
## What is Relay Attack?
 A relay attack is a hacking technique used in man-in-the-middle and replay attacks. In this attack, attacker intercepts communication between two parties and then, without viewing or manipulating it, relays it to another device.
 ## What is Replay Attack?
 A replay attack is a type of attack where the attacker captures and replays a valid message or data stream that was previously sent between two parties. The attacker may capture the message or data stream and replay it at a later time, or the attacker may intercept the message or data stream and replay it in real time.
 ## Key Fob Attack 
When you push the door unlock button on your key fob, it sends out a modulated radio signal that gets picked up by a receiver in the car. If the modulated code matches the car’s, then it will unlock. But that would be incredibly easy to hack without any additional security. All a black hat hacker would need to do is record the radio signal and then play it back later 

To overcome that possibility, modern key fobs uses a rolling code system. Each time we push the unlock button, the key fob uses an algorithm to generate a new code. The car knows the same algorithm, and the old codes are discarded each time a new one is generated.

The problem with this system is that the algorithm is not very secure. It’s based on a simple XOR operation, which is a very weak encryption algorithm. It’s so weak that it can be broken in a matter of minutes. The algorithm is also not very random, so it’s possible to predict the next code.
