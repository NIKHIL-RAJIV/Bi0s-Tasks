# IQ Signal
IQ is an abbreviation for in-phase and quadrature.

They form the basis of complex RF signal modulation and demodulation, both in hardware and in software, as well as in complex signal analysis, “quadrature” applied to both a signal and the modulation/demodulation techniques associated with that signal.

>The term “I/Q” is also used to describe the format of the data that is used to represent a complex signal. The I/Q data format is used in many applications, including software-defined radio (SDR), digital radio, and digital television.

 By convention, the I signal is a cosine waveform, and the Q signal is a sine waveform. As you know, a sine wave (without any additional phase) is shifted by 90° relative to a cosine wave.

The I/Q signal is a complex signal, which means that it is a signal that has both a magnitude and a phase. The magnitude of the I/Q signal is the same as the magnitude of the original signal, and the phase of the I/Q signal is the same as the phase of the original signal.
- The first thing to understand about I/Q signals is that they are always amplitude-modulated, not frequency- or phase-modulated. However, I/Q amplitude modulation is different from the AM technique discussed in Chapter 4: in an I/Q modulator, the signals that modulate the I/Q sinusoids are not shifted such that they are always positive. In other words, I/Q modulation involves multiplying I/Q waveforms by modulating signals that can have negative voltage values, and consequently the “amplitude” modulation can result in a 180° phase shift. 
- The second thing to understand about I/Q signals is that they are always complex signals. In other words, they have both a magnitude and a phase. The magnitude of the I/Q signal is the same as the magnitude of the original signal, and the phase of the I/Q signal is the same as the phase of the original signal.
